                <h3>Tree structure</h3>

                  <p> With other word it is <b>DOM</b> (Document Object Model) which is used in HTML to create a clear structure.
                    It reminds us for a family tree. With this structure we are able to identify different sections, or differentiate "boxes".
                    In the below picture, you can see how it is looks like. <br>

                    alt="it is a three starts with the html which branches out for head and body.
                    The head braches out for title, meta and an additional meta tags.
                    The body contains h1, p and ul tags. In this case p continues with a brach of a and ul continues with three li">

                <h3> HTML </h3>

                  <p> HTML is a <b>structure</b> using a language of the web which consists of syntax and different rules.
                    This structure consists of elements with an opening tag and a closing tag. <em>These Tags are build up based on the DOM.</em>  </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3> CSS </h3>

                  <p> CSS <em>connects with HTML</em>, because this is using a language (syntax and rules) for creating the <b>style</b> for your website.
                    With CSS you are able to color and design the background, and other things according to your taste (or the requirements of your employer).
                  </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3>Boxes</h3>

                  <p> All of the websites are building up of <em>invisible boxes</em>. You use these boxes to identify the different sections of the website.
                    You make a box for the head, body, footer, but you can tear down these to further sections with boxes. Each box is an element.
                    The following picture illustrates these boxes. <br>
