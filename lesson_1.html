            <div>

                  <p> World Wide Web (www) is a collection of HTML documents -
                    <em> HyperText Markup Language. </em>
                    The following picture is an illustration how the web is built up of its components.
                  </p>

                    alt="It shows a computer with a web browser which sends a request for the webpage, shown as an arrow through the internet
                    where it reaches the web server with an arraow. The second arrow in the same direction represents the HTTP protocoll.
                    Then the server responds by sending the webpage which is demonstrated by another arrow going back through the internet
                    and reaches the computer meaning that the browser can display the webpage">

                  <p> When <b>you</b> want to open a website you need <b>client</b> to do so -
                    <em> <b> computer</b> and <b>browser.</b> </em>
                    The browser sends request via the <b>internet</b> to <b>servers</b>.
                    These requests using the so called <b>HTTP</b> which is a protocol for communication.
                    The server responds by sending files (HTML) that your browser displays.
                  </p>

                <div>
                  <h3> HTML </h3>

                    <p> It is made up of: <p>
                      <ul>
                        <li> text content - <em>what you can see</em> </li>
                        <li> markup - <em>what it looks like</em> </li>
                        <li> references to other documents - <em>like images or videos</em> </li>
                        <li> links to other pages - <em>url</em> </li>
                      </ul>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3> Markup </h3>

                    <p> The markup is made up of <b>tags</b>.
                      These tags will help you to build a website.
                      When you want to add something to your website, you have to start with an <b>opening tab</b>
                      and after you can add the desired content.
                      When you typed that content you have to finish it with a <b>closing tag</b>. </p>

                    alt="the opening tag starts with a comperison sign contains the tag, in this case it's p and ands with another comperison sign.
                    Here comes the content, like This is a paragraph content and followed by the closing tag.
                    It begins with comperison sign, and then the slash with the p and finally the comperison sign again.">

                    <p> With the following tags you can format your text. There are more formatting tags, these are basic examples.<br>
                        b = bold - it makes your text <b>bold</b>. <br>
                        em = emphasis - it makes your text <em>italic</em>. <br>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3> HTML Attributes </h3>

                    <p>
                      For some tags you can specify attributes which provide additional information about an element, we call it value.
                      These are always given in the opening tags.  Let's see examples.
                    <p>

                    <h4> Links and Images </h4>

                      <div>
                        <p> You can use attributes for links and images. <br>
                          <br>
                          a = anchor - <em>we use this tag to create a <b>link</b></em> <br>
                          In the opening tag right after the "a" you have to write the attribute,
                          <b>href</b>(which refers to the link)="and write/copy and paste the url link here."
                          Then you have to close the opening tag.
                          In the following step you have to define the content what you want to see on the website, for eg. "Slippity Sup" which is going to appear on the screen.
                          By clicking on this, the computer will open that wepsite which you provided in the reference area (href=" "). Finish it with a closing tag. <br>

                          alt="it shows exactly how you should make a link in your code. Described above."> <br>
                          <br>

                          igm = image - <em>with this tag you can add <b>image</b>s to a website</em> <br>
                          In the opening tag right after the "img" you have to write the attribute,
                          <b>src</b>(source)="write/copy and paste here the url link or the file name which exists on your computer",
                          here you can add another attribute <b>alt</b>(alternate)=" ".
                          If you don't add this, it won't break your code. However this is nice to have in case of a broken request or could be helpful for blind. <br>
                          <img src="https://blogtutor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image-tag.gif"
                          alt="it shows exactly how you should include an image in your code. Described above.">
                        </p>
                      </div>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3> Whitespace </h3>

                  <p>
                    No matter how much space or enter you use between sentences or lines,
                    it won't appear in the browser, you can only see it in your text editor.
                    If you are willing to make some extra space you have two tags to choose from.<br>
                    <br>
                    br = break (void) - <em>this will make a line break</em> <br>
                    It is an <b>inline tag</b> which means that it only covers the space between the opening tag and the closing tag. <br>
                    <br>
                    p = paragraph - <em>this makes an individual paragraph</em> <br>
                    This is a <b>block tag</b> meaning that is bounded by an invisible box which filled by space.<br>
                    <br>
                    For further differentiation of break and paragraph, please see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0cWOZO7CV8">video</a>.

                  <h3> Framework of HTML document </h3>

                    <p>At the first place always start with !DOCTYPE html. By giving this you will identify the type of the document.</p>
